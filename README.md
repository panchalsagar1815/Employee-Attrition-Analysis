# Employee-Attrition-Analysis



Project Description:
The "Employee Attrition Analysis" project is a comprehensive machine learning initiative aimed at understanding and predicting employee attrition within a company. This project follows a structured lifecycle, encompassing data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, statistical analysis, visualization, and the application of machine learning algorithms.


**1. Dataset Overview:**
The dataset includes essential features such as EmployeeID, recorddate_key, birthdate_key, orighiredate_key, terminationdate_key, age, length_of_service, city_name, department_name, job_title, store_name, gender_short, gender_full, termreason_desc, termtype_desc, STATUS_YEAR, STATUS, and BUSINESS_UNIT.

**2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
The project initiates with a thorough exploration of the dataset, including handling missing values, checking for data inconsistencies, and transforming variables for better model performance. The preprocessing phase ensures the dataset is ready for analysis and model training.

**3. Statistical Methods and Visualization:**
Statistical methods are employed to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset. Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib aid in providing an intuitive understanding of the data. Exploratory data analysis helps identify key factors contributing to employee attrition.

**4. Feature Engineering:**
Feature engineering involves creating new relevant features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model. This step is crucial for extracting meaningful insights from the dataset.

**5. Machine Learning Model Training:**
The project utilizes two classification algorithms, Random Forest and KNN, to predict employee attrition. These algorithms are chosen for their ability to handle complex relationships within the data and provide accurate predictions. The models are trained on historical data, considering features such as age, length of service, department, and other relevant variables.

**6. Model Evaluation and Optimization:**
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The models are optimized through hyperparameter tuning to enhance their predictive capabilities.

**7. Deployment and Continuous Monitoring:**
Upon achieving satisfactory model performance, the predictive models are deployed for real-world application. Continuous monitoring ensures that the models remain effective as new data becomes available.

The "Employee Attrition Analysis" project serves as a valuable tool for HR professionals and organizational leaders, providing insights into factors influencing employee attrition and a predictive model for proactive decision-making in talent management strategies.
